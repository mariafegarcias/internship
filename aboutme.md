<h1 class="prestextarticle">Introduction</h1>

<p class="articletext">
During my university studies, I began to develop a great passion for art through my many visits to museums. I used to set aside half a day every week of my busy schedule, to devote myself entirely to a gallery and immerse myself in the world of painting. These visits enabled me to build up a visual sensitivity to the different techniques used by the great painters, but also to learn how to reconstruct the history behind them to situate the paintings in their respective contexts. Having visited all the museums in Paris, I booked my vacations to spend in cities with a strong artistic culture. London, Amsterdam and Madrid extended my knowledge of art history beyond the French context, helping me to build up a very global vision of the art world.

      During the 2022-2023 academic year I followed the cours "Histoire Générale de l'Art" as an free listener. I really enjoyed the content of this course since it allowed me to acquired the fundamental knowledge to understand art history throughout different time periods. Also, during my summer vacations, I was lucky enough to be able to attend summer courses at the École du Louvre to learn more about artists such as Van Gogh, Goya and Picasso, as well as some important periods in the history of French art, such as "the Grand Tour des artistes en voyageurs français en Italie", or more specific themes such as the technique of pastels.
