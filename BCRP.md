    <p class="articletext">
    Dengue fever, defined as "a mosquito-borne infectious disease," is becoming a growing health concern worldwide (Wang et al., 2023). Dengue mosquitoes are found in urban areas with altitudes below 2314 meters above sea level and an average temperature between 20 and 25Â°C. According to UNICEF, 34,000 cases of dengue fever were identified over the third semester of 2023. In March 2023, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a4_ensp.htm#:~:text=En%20general%2C%20se%20notificaron%20381,%5BCFR%5D%20%3D%200.17%25)">CDC </a>  reported 83,254 probable cases and 139,366 confirmed cases of dengue fever, making it the biggest dengue fever outbreak registered throughout Peru's history. Epidemic risk is one of the main triggers of a global catastrophe according to <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-inglesby-health-security/">80,000 hours </a>. The most affected regions are Piura (130 deaths), Lambayeque (115 deaths), and Ica (52 deaths). Given the context of global warming, exposure to dengue fever is increasing among the coastal population. The Ministry of Health of Peru has taken some measures to prevent more outbreaks. The dengue mosquito breeds by laying its eggs in clean water reservoirs. However, the precarious access to drinkable water of low-income populations forces them to store water in static reservoirs. Hence, the most economically vulnerable populations are also the most exposed. Even though the situation is pretty alarming, little academic evidence on the subject has been developed. Hence, the department of Social and Regional Economic Politics of the Central Bank of the Reserve of Peru will investigate the subject in order to measure the economic and social effects of this epidemic risk.
