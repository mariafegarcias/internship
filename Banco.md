    <p class="articletext">

    The frequency of climate phenomena is accelerating around the world, generating a risk for countries vulnerable to these events, such as Peru. Disasters related to climate events, such as rains and storms, have increased compared to previous decades, exacerbated by population growth and climate change (CRED, 2015; UNDRR, 2022). Due to its geographic location in the South Pacific, Peru is prone to the effects of the El Ni√±o Phenomenon (FEN), which causes intense rains, floods and periodic droughts (CEPLAN, 2023). These disasters can generate lasting damage to income and human capital, as well as induce forced displacement and reinforce the poverty cycle (Baez et al. 2010; Ronco et al. 2023; Kaushik et al. 2024; Hallegatte et al. 2016).
