<h1 class="prestextintro">Methane</h1>
<p class="articletext">
This project was organized by PSL University and the Climate Academy managed by Paris City Hall. The politics of the methane project is an interdisciplinary project between the scientific and the political view on the methane topic. The main goal was to explore the problem through all of its dimensions to understand its complexity. For this research, a group of 10 students including myself, did many interviews with different actors on the subject such as policy makers at local and national scale, farmers, political negotiators at an international scale, population and civils. In the report, we highlighted many controversial aspects of the discussion about reducing methane emissions as well as possible policy limitations within the methane public administration. A final presentation took place to vulgarize all of these notions to college students. le on the gender wage gap in STEM educational system of France, which is called CPGE (classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles). This system exists only in France and is judged to be very selective. Students are divided into two classes after the first year: one with the students with the higher grades and the other one with the lowest. After the second year, students have to pass the national exams (concours) in order to be selected by the most prestigious engineering schools. The results of this article indicate that these competitive and selective environments tend to benefit the male students more than their female counterparts. In fact, female students have 20-25% less chances than male students to enter the most prestigious engineering schools. Therefore reducing the amount of female role models in the scientific field.

<h1 class="prestextintro">Energy market</h1>
<p class="articletext">
This programmation project was organized by PSL and the Commission on Energy Regulation (CRE). The goal is to explore the different possible scenarios to consider the energetic transition of France. With my teammate, Elise Thai, we explored a monopolistic energy scenario for France. In other terms, how much would it cost for France to become energy independent? Is it even possible? To answer these questions we manipulated a Python simulation of the energy market by cutting all energy purchases from other European countries and by increasing our home nuclear energy production. The results show that this scenario wouldn’t be possible …

<h1 class="prestextintro">De-dollarization in Peru</h1>
<p class="articletext">
This research paper on the economic policies of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru between 2014 to 2022 deals with the topic of de-dollarization. The 2015 wave of de-dollarization pushed developing countries to incentivize the use of their own currency in their territory. In this research paper, I did a literature review of the article concerning the incredible success of the process of de-dollarization of Peru.
