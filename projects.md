    <p class="articletext">
      This project was organized by PSL University and the Climate Academy managed by Paris City Hall. The main goal was to explore the problem through all of its dimensions to understand its complexity using voth political and scientifical knowledge. For this research, a group of 10 students including myself, did many interviews with different actors on the subject such as policy makers at local and national scale, farmers and scientifics. This was a group project done by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-thai-092543212/">Elise Thai</a>, Manon Bleuzen, Robin Frenet, Charlotte Touzeau, Manon Le Teuff, Mathilde Branchet, Clément Bellin, Valentine Baudry et Alfred Pavret De La Rochefordière.

    <h1 class="prestextarticle">Energy market(2022)</h1>
    <p class="articletext">
    This programmation project was organized by PSL and the Commission on Energy Regulation (CRE). The goal is to explore the different possible scenarios to consider the energetic transition of France. With my teammate, Elise Thai, we explored a monopolistic energy scenario for France. In other terms, how much would it cost for France to become energy independent? Is it even possible? To answer these questions we manipulated a Python simulation of the energy market by cutting all energy purchases from other European countries and by increasing our home nuclear energy production. The results show that the cost of achievement this energetic independence implies doubling the price of electricity in winter as well as frequent blackouts.

    <p class="articletext">
    This research paper on the economic policies of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru between 2014 to 2022 deals with the topic of de-dollarization. The 2015 wave of de-dollarization pushed developing countries to incentivize the use of their own currency in their territory. In this research paper, I did a literature review of the article concerning the incredible success of the process of de-dollarization of Peru.

    <h1 class="prestextarticle">Low emissions zones (2024)</h1>
    <p class="articletext">
    This 6 week project aimed to study the controversy surrounding the implementation of low emission zones also known as "LZE" in France. A low emission zone is defined as a zone in which only cars that respect some specfic criteria (Crit'Air) are allowed to circulate. In the French case, the criteria is based only on the age of the vehicle. The goal of the LZE is to improve the air quality of cities that are exceeding the threshold established by the Ministry of the Ecological Transition to protect the health of the population. The project consisted of multiple weeks of litterature research, starting to dig into the media press, then into the tehcnical and administratives reports and finally the academic research. Hence, we acquired a broad approach of the members contributing to this topic in the citizen, political and academic sphere. The participants of this project are: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-thai-092543212/">Elise Thai</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clara-sefzig-70357a238/">Clara Sefzig</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-bornscheuer-403856273/">Elisa Bornscheuer</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucie-açarq-932674235/">Lucie Açarq</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-zajac-30919b217/">Emily Zajac</a>. Our tutor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-zajac-30919b217/">Nicolas Delaffon</a> oriented us during this whole project and we would like to thank him for his precious advice.
