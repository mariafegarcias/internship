    <p class="articletext">
    Abstract: In the context of the climate crisis, the increase in the frequency of extreme cli- matic conditions and catastrophic events are raising concerns. In Peru, coastal populations are submitted to both ENSO and climate change stress which increases future huaycos and floods events enhancing their vulnerability facing natural hazard. Assessing vulnerability is crucial to build policies that will aim to support and protect the population at more risk. Moreover, adverse effects of cli- mate disaster will not be proportionally distributed throughout the population. The recover capacity of marginalized and low income communities place them at greater danger when facing flood events. Hence, we will be focusing on the social, economical and institutional dimension of vulnerability using the more accurate methods used in the literature: the Flood Vulnerability Index composite [1] and the SoVI Index [2]. Finally, we will display a vulnerability map and compare the results between the two methods.
