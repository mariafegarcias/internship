During the second semester of 2022-2023 I did an internship at PSE (Paris School of Economics) working for Lea Dousset and Cecile Bonneau, both PhD doctorates on the article on the gender wage gap in STEM educational system of France, which is called CPGE (classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles). This system exists only in France and is judged to be very selective. Students are divided into two classes after the first year: one with the students with the higher grades and the other one with the lowest. After the second year, students have to pass the national exams (concours) in order to be selected by the most prestigious engineering schools. The results of this article indicate that these competitive and selective environments tend to benefit the male students more than their female counterparts. In fact, female students have 20-25% less chances than male students to enter the most prestigious engineering schools. Therefore reducing the amount of female role models in the scientific field.

My first mission during this internship was mainly to clean the data of the gender wage gap salary between engineering schools. So, I had the mean wage of female and male students for each engineering school in France. I also did some literature review on the subjects of Women in STEM. My second mission was to treat the data by creating a Stata code that will match all the information gathered by another dataset according to the schools and the year. In order to do that, I had to create the code to merge many large datasets to analyze the data afterwards. </p>

Moreover for my internship report I conducted my own research on the “She-Cession” of 2019. Studies show that women’s salaries shrink more than men due to three main reasons: maternity, women helding most of their jobs in the service sector which was shut down during Covid, and the big proportion of partial jobs that were more vulnerable during the crisis. However, the results of my research show that women who didn’t fulfill these cases, young engineering graduate female students with no children in the labor market, were also strongly affected in comparison to their male counterparts by a decrease in their salary.

To pursue my research, I analyzed the decomposition of the salary according to the data I had. Finding showed that the bonus wage had a very important weight in this gender gap. To evaluate the weight of the bonus wage in the general gender gap I did a quartile decomposition. The bonus wage gender gap explains around 60% to 45% of the general gender gap for the 2 lowest quartiles and between 60% to 38% across all quartiles. So, we can say that the bonus wage gender gap is a very important factor to take into consideration when discussing the possible solutions to adjust the gender wage gap.
